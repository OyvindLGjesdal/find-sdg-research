## 3.Targets

## Target 13.1

> **13.1 Strengthen resilience and adaptive capacity to climate-related hazards and natural disasters in all countries**
>
>13.1.1 Number of deaths, missing persons and directly affected persons attributed to disasters per 100,000 population
>
>13.1.2 Number of countries that adopt and implement national disaster risk reduction strategies in line with the Sendai Framework for Disaster Risk Reduction 2015â€“2030
>
>13.1.3 Proportion of local governments that adopt and implement local disaster risk reduction strategies in line with national disaster risk reduction strategies

This target is interpreted to cover research about how to strengthen resilience to climate-related hazards and natural disasters. Strategies dealing with climate-related hazards and natural disasters and how to minimize impact of climate-related hazards and natural disasters are considered to be a method to improve resilience. 

For climate-related hazards and natural disasters both generel terms (phrase 1) and specific hazards/desasters (phrase 2) are used.
This query consists of 2 phrases.

##### Phrase 1: 

Action: strengthen/improve OR establish "risk planning" 

Basic structure: (strengthen/improve reslience OR "risk planning" ) + disasters

Disasters contain both general terms and specific desasters

## Target 13.2 

> **13.2 Integrate climate change measures into national policies, strategies and planning**
>
>13.2.1 Number of countries with nationally determined contributions, long-term strategies, national adaptation plans and adaptation communications, as reported to the secretariat of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change
>
>13.2.2 Total greenhouse gas emissions per year		

This target is interpreted to cover research about national policies, strategies and planning related to
  - climate change mitigation and adaptation as general topics, inkl. reducing the impacts of indicators of climate change 
  - reduction of greenhouse gases as a fixed class,and six main greenhouse gases (phrase 2)
  - and generel Frameworks for action (phrase 3)

Indicators of climate change are here interpreted as changes that can be observed and measured (https://library.wmo.int/doc_num.php?explnum_id=10618): global mean surface temperature, global ocean heat content, state of ocean acidification, glacier mass balance, Arctic and Antarctic sea-ice extent, global CO2 fraction and global mean sea level

Carbon capture/storage technology can contribute to climate mitigation (i.e. reduction of GHG) but in order to be consistent with our target interpretation method, any papers concerning it must relate the work to climate mitigation or reductions of GHG to be included. The same would apply to reforestation or other mitigation measures. Thus these are not included as individual search terms but assumed to be included in the given phrases.

This query consists of 3 phrases.

##### Phrase 2:
National policies, strategies and planning related to reduction of GHGs = main climate mitigation according to the 2014 IPCC Synthesis Report<sup id="IPCC2014">[3](#f4)</sup> UNEP definition .
The second part of this phrase covers the six main greenhouse gases (covered by the Kyoto Protocol) as listed in the 2014 IPCC Synthesis Report<sup id="IPCC2014">[3](#f4)</sup>. This parts need to be linked to climate change 

Action: reduce

)
```

##### Phrase 3:

Frameworks for action are included, as documents referencing these are likely to be discussing climate action (i.e. applied climate science rather than basic). This does pick up some results to do with energy transitions, but generally as related to climate. IPCC not included as their scenarios are referred to as a reference very often and in fields not necessarily directly contributing to the targets.

  OR "UNFCCC" OR "United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change"

## Target 13.3								

> **13.3 Improve education, awareness-raising and human and institutional capacity on climate change mitigation, adaptation, impact reduction and early warning**
>
>13.3.1 Extent to which (i) global citizenship education and (ii) education for sustainable development are mainstreamed in (a) national education policies; (b) curricula; (c) teacher education; and (d) student assessment

This target is considered to cover research about improving education, general awareness and capacity about climate change mitigation, adaptaion and impact reduction. It also covers technical knowledge transfer, international aid related to this topics. 
Interpretatation of what should be considered as contributing to "human and institutional capacity" is challenging - according to the UNDG definition, it concerns anything that would increase the ability of people and institutions to successfully manage climate change mitigation, adaption, impact reduction and early warning. Here consider we that all research on these topics would contribute, and therefore they do not have to be combined with the concept of capacity.

We include general terms about cimate change mitigation as well as the reduction og greenhouse gases as the main method of climate change mitigation.

This query consists of 1 phrase.

`Green climate fund` is a dedicated climate fund.
