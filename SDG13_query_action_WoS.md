Reduction of GHGs = main climate mitigation according to UNEP definition

##### Phrase 4:
The second part of this phrase covers the six main greenhouse gases (covered by the Kyoto Protocol) as listed in the 2014 IPCC Synthesis Report<sup id="IPCC2014">[3](#f4)</sup>.
this parts need to be linked to climate change 
 

``` Ceylon =

    OR (("climate" OR "atmospher*" OR "ocean") NEAR/3 "warming")
    )
)
```

##### Phrase 5:

Frameworks for action are included, as documents referencing these are likely to be discussing climate action (i.e. applied climate science rather than basic). This does pick up some results to do with energy transitions, but generally as related to climate. IPCC not included as their scenarios are referred to as a reference very often and in fields not necessarily directly contributing to the targets.

``` Ceylon =
TS=
(
  "Kyoto protocol"
  OR "Paris Agreement"
  OR "COP 21" OR "COP21" OR "COP 22" OR "COP22" OR "COP 23" OR "COP23" OR "COP 24" OR "COP24"
  OR "UNFCCC" OR "United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change"
)
```

Carbon capture/storage technology can contribute to climate mitigation (i.e. reduction of GHG) but in order to be consistent with our target interpretation method, any papers concerning it must relate the work to climate mitigation or reductions of GHG to be included. The same would apply to reforestation or other mitigation measures. Thus these are not included as individual search terms but are included in the given phrases.

## Target 13.b

> **13.b Promote mechanisms for raising capacity for effective climate change-related planning and management in least developed countries and small island developing States, including focusing on women, youth and local and marginalized communities**
>
>13.b.1 Number of least developed countries and small island developing States with nationally determined contributions, long-term strategies, national adaptation plans and adaptation communications, as reported to the secretariat of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change


Covered by phrase 1 &  2 from target 13.2


## Target 13.3 & 13.a								

> **13.3 Improve education, awareness-raising and human and institutional capacity on climate change mitigation, adaptation, impact reduction and early warning**
>
>13.3.1 Extent to which (i) global citizenship education and (ii) education for sustainable development are mainstreamed in (a) national education policies; (b) curricula; (c) teacher education; and (d) student assessment

> **13.a Implement the commitment undertaken by developed-country parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change to a goal of mobilizing jointly $100Â billion annually by 2020 from all sources to address the needs of developing countries in the context of meaningful mitigation actions and transparency on implementation and fully operationalize the Green Climate Fund through its capitalization as soon as possible**
>
>13.a.1 Amounts provided and mobilized in United States dollars per year in relation to the continued existing collective mobilization goal of the $100 billion commitment through to 2025

Re target 13.3 - Interpretatation of what should be considered as contributing to "human and institutional capacity" is challenging - according to the UNDG definition, it concerns anything that would increase the ability of people and institutions to successfully manage climate change mitigation, adaption, impact reduction and early warning. Here consider we that all research on these topics would contribute, and therefore they do not have to be combined with the concept of capacity.
