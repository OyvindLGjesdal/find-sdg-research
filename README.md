# Information about these files - SDGstrings_wos

This work is a product of the project *Bærekraftsforskning for alle – en transparent kartleggings- og gjenfinningstjeneste* (Sustainable development research for all – a transparent mapping and discovery tool), a Norwegian project supported by the National Library of Norway. **[Read more about the project and find contact details here](https://www.uib.no/en/ub/148804/sustainable-development-research-all-%E2%80%93-transparent-mapping-and-discovery-tool)**.

The files in this repository contain search strings to find publications related to certain [Sustainable development goals](https://sdgs.un.org/goals). The strings are formatted to be copied and pasted into the advanced search interface in the Web of Science core collection. **The strings are a work-in-progress, and are at different stages of development - within each file there is a description of its current status at the top.** 

Each file contains a search string for a specific SDG, broken up into phrases by target. File names consist of the SDG and the approach used (topic vs. action). The approach relates to decisions about what kind of research the string should find: research closely related to the actions of the SDG targets ("action"), or research more broadly related to the topics in the targets ("topic"). These approaches are described in [Armitage, Lorenz & Mikki (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1162/qss_a_00071). 

The release v.2019-12 contains strings for SDGs 1,2,3,7,13 & 14 developed during 2019, and should be the same as those deposited openly on publication of [Armitage, Lorenz & Mikki (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1162/qss_a_00071). The original uploads of these strings (tab format, published May 2020) can be found at: *Armitage, Lorenz, Mikki (2020), "Replication data for: Mapping scholarly publications related to the Sustainable Development Goals: Do independent bibliometric approaches get the same results?", https://doi.org/10.18710/98CMDR, DataverseNO, V1*
