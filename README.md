# SDGstrings_wos

This repository contains search strings to find publications related to certain [Sustainable development goals](https://sdgs.un.org/goals). The files are a work-in-progress. It is a product of the project *Bærekraftsforskning for alle – en transparent kartleggings- og gjenfinningstjeneste* (Sustainable development research for all – a transparent mapping and discovery tool), a Norwegian project supported by the National Library of Norway. [Read more about the project here](https://www.uib.no/en/ub/148804/sustainable-development-research-all-%E2%80%93-transparent-mapping-and-discovery-tool).

Each file contains a search string, broken up into phrases, for a specific SDG. File names consist of the SDG and the approach used. The approach relates to decisions about what kind of research the string should find: research closely related to the actions of the SDG targets ("action"), or research more broadly related to the topics in the targets ("topic"). These approaches are described in [Armitage, Lorenz & Mikki (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1162/qss_a_00071). **The strings are currently a work-in-progress, and are at different stages of development - within each file there is a description of its current status at the top.**

The release v.2019-12 contains strings for SDGs 1,2,3,7,13 & 14 developed during 2019, and should be the same as those deposited openly on publication of [Armitage, Lorenz & Mikki (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1162/qss_a_00071). The original uploads of these strings (tab format, published May 2020) can be found at: *Armitage, Lorenz, Mikki (2020), "Replication data for: Mapping scholarly publications related to the Sustainable Development Goals: Do independent bibliometric approaches get the same results?", https://doi.org/10.18710/98CMDR, DataverseNO, V1*
