# SDGstrings_wos

This repository contains search strings for Web of Science core collection (SCIE, AHCI, SSCI, ESCI) to find publications related to the sustainable development goals. It is connected to the project *Bærekraftsforskning for alle – en transparent kartleggings- og gjenfinningstjeneste* (Sustainable development research for all – a transparent mapping and discovery tool), a Norwegian project supported by the National Library of Norway. 

The release v.2019-12 contains strings developed during 2019, and should be the same as those deposited openly on publication of the article *Armitage, CS.; Lorenz, M; Mikki, S. 2020. Mapping scholarly publications related to the Sustainable Development Goals: Do independent bibliometric approaches get the same results? Quantitative Science Studies. doi: https://doi.org/10.1162/qss_a_00071*. The original uploads of these strings (tab format, published May 2020) can be found at:
