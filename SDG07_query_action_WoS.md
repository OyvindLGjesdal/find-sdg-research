## 3. Targets

## Target 7.1

These targets are combined, as they cover similar topics.

> **7.1 By 2030, ensure universal access to affordable, reliable and modern energy services**
>
> 7.1.1 Proportion of population with access to electricity
>
> 7.1.2 Proportion of population with primary reliance on clean fuels and technology

This query consists of 5 phrases.

##### Phrase 1:

This phrase focuses on the clean fuels and technology part of the T&Is. Clean cooking is part of this, mentioned in the high level political forum document <sup id="HLPF2018">[2](#f2)</sup>. `solar cookers` are a type of clean cooking technology.

The second half of this phrase contains terms for various aspects:
* Usage rates and availability
* Barriers to increase
* Implementation
* Research concerning bringing technology to users
* Policy
* Incentives. Investment concerns target 7.A

          OR "technolog*"            
          OR "cooking" OR "stove$"

      OR "incentive$" OR "investment$" OR "investing" OR "invest"
      OR "sustainable development" OR "sustainable energy development"
      )
)
```
##### Phrase 2:

This phrase focuses on the universal and affordable access to electricity part of the T&Is. Papers discussing reliability and resilience of power grids are included. Some aspects about infrastructure also concern target 7.A/7.B.

`energy` and `power` are combined with other terms to avoid hits from other subject areas (biological energy, mechanical power). NEAR/2 is used as they should be almost next to each other.

*Comment 03092021 - note the typo in the second expression for infrastructure*

```Ceylon =
TS=
(
  ( "affordab*"
  OR "access*"
  OR "reliab*" OR "resilien*"
  OR "equitab*"
  OR
    ("infrastructure"

    )

        )
      OR "off grid solution$"  
      )
)
```

##### Phrase 3:

`stable` and `stability` are very general words, so are combined with other terms here to reflect reliability.

The terms in the first expression are more specific so can be combined more loosely (`AND`) to electricity/energy.

*Comment 03092021 - note the typo in the second expression for infrastructure*

```Ceylon =
TS=
(
  ("stable supply" OR "supply stability" OR "grid stability"
  OR
    ("moderni*"
    NEAR/3
        ("energy" OR "power" OR "electricity" OR "grid" OR "grids")

      OR "microgrid" OR "microgrids" OR "micro-grid" OR "micro-grids"
      OR "off grid solution$"  
      )
)
```

##### Phrase 4:

Access relates to energy poverty, security, justice etc.

```Ceylon =

  "universal electrification" OR "rural electrification"
  OR "energy security" OR "energy insecurity"
  OR "energy poverty" OR "energy vulnerability" OR "fuel poverty"
  OR "energy democracy" OR "energy justice"
)
```

##### Phrase 5:

Universal access, covering electrification of remote/rural regions. Least developed countries are likely to be relevant in the context of universal electrification and access for all. Lists of least developed countries, small island developing states and landlocked developing states are from the United Nations World Economic Situation and Prospects (tables F, H and I, pages 173-174)<sup id="UNLDCs">[3](#f3)</sup>.

## Target 7.2

> **7.2 By 2030, increase substantially the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix**
>
> 7.2.1 Renewable energy share in the total final energy consumption

This query consists of 2 phrases.

Search limited with terms that concern the changing of energy systems to renewables (incentives, policies), bringing of technology into use (commercialisation, scaling up) and measures that reflect the share of renewables. Basic research on renewable technology not included unless addresses these concepts around increasing the global share of renewables.

##### Phrase 1:

```Ceylon =
TS=
(
  "energy sector transformation"
  OR "renewable energy transition$" OR "national energy transition$"
  OR
    (
      ("share" OR "shares" OR "proportion$" OR "percentage$")
      NEAR/3
          ("renewables" OR "carbon-neutral" OR "green electricity" OR "green energy" OR "green power")
    )
)
```
##### Phrase 2:

The first half of this phrase contains terms for various aspects:
* Usage rates and availability
* Terms for global energy mix/supplies/markets/shares
* Barriers to increase
* Implementation. Here "transition" alone was too general so is combined.
* Research concerning bringing technology to users
* Policy
* Incentives

They are then combined with various types of renewable energy generation in the second expression. `solar energy` is combined with technological terms to prevent hits from astronomy. `biomass`, `wind` and `solar` combined with other terms to prevent hits from other subject areas.

Energy storage and smart grids to deal with fluctuations in supply are part of renewable energy transition (req. for renewables), inferred from the high level political forum document <sup id="HLPF2018">[2](#f2)</sup>.

## Target 7.3

> **7.3 By 2030, double the global rate of improvement in energy efficiency**
>
> 7.3.1 Energy intensity measured in terms of primary energy and GDP

This query consists of 2 phrases.

##### Phrase 1:

The term "energy intensity" is combined with these other terms to prevent finding publications using the term in other contexts. Energy intensity definition from the European Environment Agency:
>"Energy intensity is the ratio between gross inland energy consumption (GIEC) and gross domestic product (GDP), calculated for a calendar year. GIEC is calculated as the sum of the gross inland consumption of the five sources of energy: solid fuels, oil, gas, nuclear and renewable sources" <sup id="EEA2016">[4](#f4)</sup>.

```Ceylon =
TS=
(
  ("energy intensity"
  AND
      ("energy consum*" OR "sustainab*" OR "energy efficiency"
      OR "GDP" OR "economic" OR "economy" OR "economies"
      OR "industry" OR "industrial" OR "manufacturing"
      OR ("emission$" NEAR/5 ("carbon" OR "co2"))

  OR
  (
    ("economic growth" OR "GDP")
    NEAR/15
        ("energy use$" OR "energy consum*")
  )
)
```

##### Phrase 2:

Phrase 2 involves a `NOT` expression. This is to remove results concerning biological energy efficiency. Uses of `metabolism` as a term outside of biology are retained using a double negative `NOT` statement.

The first part includes mechanisms by which increases can be brought about.
