## 3. Targets

## Target 3.1/3.2

These targets are combined, as they cover similar topics.

> **3.1 By 2030, reduce the global maternal mortality ratio to less than 70 per 100,000 live births.**
>
> 3.1.1 Maternal mortality ratio
>
> 3.1.2 Proportion of births attended by skilled health personnel

> **2.2 3.2 By 2030, end preventable deaths of newborns and children under 5 years of age, with all countries aiming to reduce neonatal mortality to at least as low as 12 per 1,000 live births and under‑5 mortality to at least as low as 25 per 1,000 live births**
>
> 3.2.1 Under‑5 mortality rate
>
> 3.2.2 Neonatal mortality rate

The target concerns children under five, but it is extremely difficult to limit this bibliometrically since it is often referred to as childhood mortality, thus we include "child*"

This query consists of 2 phrases.

##### Phrase 1:

`lower`, `limited` and `limits` are not used due to general use (e.g. "limited understanding")

```Ceylon =
TS=
(
  (   ("child*" OR "infant$" OR "under-five"
        OR "fetus" OR "foetus" OR "fetal" OR "foetal" OR "perinatal" OR "prenatal" OR "neonatal" OR "antenatal" OR "newborn$"
        OR (("premature" OR "preterm") NEAR/3 ("birth$" OR "babies" OR "baby"))
        OR "maternal" OR "mothers" OR "childbirth" OR "child-birth" OR "birth"
      )
      NEAR/5
          ("mortality" OR "death$" OR "stillbirth$" OR "still-birth$")
  )
  NEAR/5
      ("prevent*" OR "reduc*" OR "decreas*" OR "minimi*" OR "lowering" OR "lowered" OR "limit" OR "limiting" OR "combat*" OR "tackl*" OR "eliminat*" OR "avoid*")
)
```
##### Phrase 2:

Phrase 2 is the opposite of phrase 1 (i.e. reduce mortality = increase survival)

```Ceylon =
TS=
(
  (   ("child*" OR "infant$" OR "under-five"
       OR "fetus" OR "foetus" OR "fetal" OR "foetal" OR "perinatal" OR "prenatal" OR "neonatal" OR "antenatal" OR "newborn$"
       OR (("premature" OR "preterm") NEAR/3 ("birth$" OR "babies" OR "baby"))
       OR "maternal" OR "mothers" OR "childbirth" OR "child-birth" OR "birth"
      )
      NEAR/5
          ("surviv*")
  )
  NEAR/5
      ("improv*" OR "increas*" OR "enhanc*")
)
```
## Target 3.3

> **3.3 By 2030, end the epidemics of AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria and neglected tropical diseases and combat hepatitis, water-borne diseases and other communicable diseases.**
>
> 3.3.1 Number of new HIV infections per 1,000 uninfected population, by sex, age and key populations
>
> 3.3.2 Tuberculosis incidence per 100,000 population
>
> 3.3.3 Malaria incidence per 1,000 population
>
> 3.3.4 Hepatitis B incidence per 100,000 population
>
> 3.3.5 Number of people requiring interventions against neglected tropical diseases

This query consists of 1 phrase.

The first section deals with waterborne and communicable diseases in general. Note that this also finds "non contagious" "non transmissable" "non communicable" diseases - considered ok since these are covered in target 3.4

The second section starts listing specific diseases.
`hepatitis`, `tuberculosis`, `HIV`, `malaria` are taken directly from the target. Note that `AIDS` is not used as it is often used as a verb. To list  additional diseases, we used the World Health Organisation's (WHO) Global Health Observatory data repository for adding specific vaccine preventable & communicable diseases<sup id="WHOGHO">[2](#f2)</sup>.
A number of these diseases also occur in animals (e.g. Feline/Simian Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome, Canine hepatitis, Avian malaria, Bovine tuberculosis). We do not attempt to exclude them, as it is considered that work on their prevention/treatment can inform human prevention/treatment, or prevent zoonotic transmission.
STIs and STDs also included as categories of communicable diseases, as sexual health is mentioned in another target

The third section lists neglected tropical diseases, as mentioned in the target. We used the WHOs website to add specific neglected tropical diseases<sup id="WHONTD">[3](#f3)</sup>.

The final part specifies action. Ending epidemics is specifically mentioned in the target. Note that treatment terms are also relevant for this point, as an epidemic can be ended by treatment, prevention, etc.

## Target 3.4

This query consists of 2 phrases.

##### Phrase 1:

Note that premature death from these diseases can be covered within the phrasing of the action part (e.g. prevent premature mortality from noncommunicable diseases).

##### Phrase 2:

Used World Health Organisation's (WHO) factsheets to add types of mental disorders<sup id="WHOFSmental">[7](#f7)</sup>. As the focus of the target is "mental health", developmental disorders included by WHO (e.g. autism) were not included.

``` Ceylon =
